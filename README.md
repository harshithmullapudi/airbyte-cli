##  Configuration as YAML
Before we interact with Airbyte API, we need to set Airbyte API URL and workspace, for which you can use the following command
```bash
$ airbyte set-config
```

##  Usage
An Airbyte CLI command has the following structure:
```bash
$ airbyte <command> <subcommand> [options and parameters]
```
```
<command>
          get - Get configuration of Sources/Destinations/Connections
          search - Search in sources
          check - Check connection to Source/Destination
          logs - Fetch logs for a job
          set-config - Set your airbyte url and workspaceID
          help - Help about any command
```
To view help documentation, use one of the following:
```bash
$ airbyte -h
$ airbyte <command> -h
$ airbyte <command> <subcommand> -h
```
## get
Return all
   - sources (`/v1/sources/list`)
   - destinations (`/v1/destinations/list`)
   - connections (`/v1/web_backend/connections/list`)

You can use page(p) and offset(o) to fetch sources respectively. 

To list sources, the command would be:
```bash
$ airbyte get sources
```
To get a source, the command would be:
```bash
$ airbyte get source [sourceId]
```
To get jobs for a connection, the command would be:
```bash
$ airbyte get jobs [connectionId]
```

## search
   - sources
   - connections

To search in sources, the command would be:
```bash
$ airbyte search sources [string]
```

## check
Validate
   - source (`/v1/sources/check_connection`)
   - destination (`/v1/destinations/check_connection`)

To validate a source, the command would be:
```bash
$ airbyte check source [sourceId]
```

## logs
Get logs for a job
```bash
$ airbyte logs [jobId]
```
